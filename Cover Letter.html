    <h1>Cover Letter – Software Engineer II</h1>

    <p>Dear Hiring Team at Sezzle,</p>

    <p>
        I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer II position. For the past few years, I have been working as a 
        full-stack developer building web and mobile features with React, React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, and 
        relational databases. I enjoy taking ownership of problems, collaborating with teammates, and delivering 
        solutions that make a real impact—values that strongly align with Sezzle’s culture and expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my current roles, I have designed and shipped new product features end-to-end, improved performance across 
        large codebases, migrated applications to more modern and stable stacks, and supported production environments. 
        I regularly participate in code reviews, mentor junior developers, and work closely with product stakeholders 
        to ensure features meet both technical and business needs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Although most of my experience is in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, I adapt quickly to new technologies 
        and I am motivated by challenges. I am confident I can ramp up effectively with Go and contribute to Sezzle’s 
        backend and microservice architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        What draws me to Sezzle is the combination of fast-paced innovation, strong engineering standards, and a mission 
        that genuinely improves access and opportunity. I would be excited to bring my experience, curiosity, and 
        problem-solving mindset to your team.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Sezzle’s growth 
        and helping build the future of shopping.
    </p>

    <p>Sincerely,<br><strong>Joaquín Angelino Corona</strong></p>
